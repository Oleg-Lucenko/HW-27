        <p>Breathing is the process that brings  oxygen in the air into your lungs and moves oxygen and through your body. Our lungs remove the oxygen and pass it through our bloodstream, where it's carried off to the tissues and organs that allow us to walk, talk, and move.
        Our lungs also take carbon dioxide from our blood and release it into the air when we breathe out. </p>
        <p>The SINUSES are hollow spaces in the bones of your head. Small openings connect them to the nasal cavity. The sinuses help to regulate the temperature and humidity of air your breathe in, as well as to lighten the bone structure of the head and to give tone to your voice.</p>
        <p>The NASAL CAVITY (nose) is the best entrance for outside air into your respiratory system. The hairs that line the inside wall are part of the air-cleansing system.</p>
        <p>Air can also enters through your  ORAL CAVITY (mouth), especially if you have a mouth-breathing habit or your nasal passages may be temporarily blocked.</p>
        <p>The ADENOIDS are overgrown lymph tissue at the top of the throat. When your adenoids  interfere with your breathing, they are sometimes removed. The lymph system, consisting of nodes (knots of cells) and connecting vessels, carries fluid throughout the body. This system helps your body resist infection by filtering out foreign matter, including germs, and producing cells (lymphocytes) to fight them.</p>
        <p>The PHARYNX (throat) collects incoming air from your nose and passes it downward to your trachea (windpipe).
        The EPIGLOTTIS is a flap of tissue that guards the entrance to your trachea. It closes when anything is swallowed that should go into the esophagus and stomach.
        The LARYNX (voice box) contains your vocal cords. When  moving air is  breathed in and out, it creates voice sounds.
        The ESOPHAGUS is the passage leading from your mouth and throat to your stomach.
        The TRACHEA (windpipe) is the passage leading from your pharynx to the lungs.
        The RIBS are bones supporting and protecting your chest cavity. They move a small amount and help the lungs to expand and contract.</p>
