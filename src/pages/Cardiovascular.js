        <h1>Cardiovascular System</h1>
        <p>The cardiovascular system has a very important function ― getting oxygen and nutrients to your entire body and removing waste. Your cells depend on your cardiovascular system to get what they need to keep running smoothly. That’s why it’s vital to take care of your heart with exercise, a healthy diet and controlled blood pressure and cholesterol.</p>
        <h2> What is the cardiovascular system?</h2>
        <p>Your heart and many blood vessels in your body make up your cardiovascular system or circulatory system. Your heart uses the far-reaching, intricate network of blood vessels to deliver oxygen and other necessary things to your whole body. This network also removes the things your body doesn’t need and takes them to organs that can get rid of the waste. Your blood carries the oxygen, nutrients and waste through your entire body.</p>
        <h2>What does the cardiovascular system do?</h2>
        <p>The function of the cardiovascular system is to make sure your body gets the oxygen, nutrients and other things it needs and gets rid of things it doesn’t.
            Day and night, even while you’re asleep, your heart moves blood through your body. This is why your healthcare provider can hear your heartbeat. It’s the sound of your heart doing its job. Your heart circulates about 2,000 gallons of blood every day.
            Some blood vessels (veins) bring blood to your heart, while others (arteries) carry blood away from your heart. Your blood vessels also take away waste (like carbon dioxide) from your cells.
            Blood always follows the same route through your heart. Valves along the route make sure the blood is going the right way.</p>
            
        <h2>Two important circulation processes</h2>
            <h3>Pulmonary circulation</h3>
            <p>Blood without oxygen comes into the right side of your heart and is sent to the lungs to get oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide. Then the oxygenated blood comes back through the left side of your heart.</p>

            <h3>Systemic circulation</h3>
            <p>Blood that has just gotten oxygen from the lungs and returned through your heart’s left side is pushed out to the rest of your body’s cells so they can receive oxygen and nutrients. The cycle starts again when blood without oxygen goes to the right side of your heart.</p>

        <h2> How does the cardiovascular system help with other organs?</h2>
        <p>The cardiovascular system (your heart and blood vessels) supplies your body’s organs with oxygen and nutrients so your organs can do their jobs. Your blood vessels also carry carbon dioxide and other waste away for disposal.</p>

        <p>Your cardiovascular system also helps your body:</p>

        <p>Get what it needs during exercise, as well as during rest.
        Keep your temperature at a normal level.</p>
       <h2>What does the structure of the cardiovascular system look like?</h2>
       <p>Your heart is a very important part of your cardiovascular system because it powers the system that brings your cells what they need and takes away what they don’t. Your heart connects to a network of blood vessels all over your body.
        If you’ve ever seen water or sewer pipes under the street, you know they are very large. These pipes lead to smaller and smaller pipes that carry water into your house and sewage out of your house. Similar to the main pipes under the street, the blood vessels going into and out of your heart are the largest in your body. They connect to smaller and smaller blood vessels as they get farther away from your heart to deliver oxygen and remove waste throughout your entire body. Capillaries, the tiniest of blood vessels, transfer oxygen, nutrients and waste between your blood vessels and your tissue cells.</p>
