       <h1>Human Body Organ Systems</h1>

        <p>The organ systems of the human body all have specific functions. The VA uses the categories of major organ systems to classify disability claims. Here, we will break down how the different organ systems match up with the VAâ€™s disability systems.</p>

       <h2>How Are Organ Systems Connected to VA Disability Ratings?</h2>
        <p>Our bodies are made up of 11 basic organ systems that manage all the essential body functions. These systems, while interdependent, can become out of tune. When one is not functioning properly, the others will attempt to correct the problem. All the systems will work together to try to create what is known as homeostasis or a state of balance within the body.
            The 11 organ systems include the integumentary system, skeletal system, muscular system, lymphatic system, respiratory system, digestive system, nervous system, endocrine system, cardiovascular system, urinary system, and reproductive systems.     
            The VA defines 14 disability systems, which are similar to the body systems. However, the disability systems are separated differently for rating purposes. These systems are listed with the medical listing and are identified independently when necessary.
            These 14 systems are the Musculoskeletal system; Organs of Special Sense (optical); Auditory; Infectious Diseases, Immune Disorders, and Nutritional Deficiencies; Respiratory system; Cardiovascular system; Digestive system; Genitourinary System; Hemic and Lymphatic system; Skin; Endocrine system; Neurological conditions; Mental Disorders, and Dental and Oral conditions.
            For Individual Unemployability ratings; if you are rated with more than one disability within one body system, your rating will increase towards unemployability. For this reason, we have outlined the VA defined body systems and have included a link to our VA Unemployability Calculator so you can see if your ratings make you eligible for Individual Unemployment.
            Below is a description of the basic functions of each system as well as some of the diseases and disorders associated with each system. These lists are not complete and do not take the place of medical advice.</p>
